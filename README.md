# Intelligence Collection Planner

**Intelligence Collection Planner** is a lightweight, web-based tool for organizing and managing intelligence collection tasks. With this tool, users can create and link hypotheses to intelligence requirements (PIRs), assign priority levels, and oversee tasks from the planning stage to completion. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires no external dependencies, making it easy to set up and customize.

## Features

- **Hypothesis Management:** Create, edit, and delete hypotheses, and link them to PIRs.
- **PIR Tracking:** Add and prioritize intelligence requirements (PIRs) with flexible linking to multiple hypotheses.
- **Collection Task Workflow:** Progress tasks through stages â€” from initial collection to a final task list.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **No Dependencies:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with zero external libraries required.
